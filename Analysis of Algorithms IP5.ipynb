    "My overall plan to search for a Sudoku solution given a starting state is to iterate through the first row of the puzzle, fill in the empty squares and iterate through to rest of the rows until complete.  Go through the columns to make sure that the solutions for the columns are correct.  If I implemented this plan, the first vertices would represent the possible solutions for the first row, and the child nodes of those vertices would represent the possible solutions the second row, and the child nodes of those vertices would be the solutions to the third row and so on.  \n",

The traditional sudoku challenge is nine squares long and nine squares wide (9x9) so n would need to be squared to find how many individual squares are there in the board.  So we would need to through all possible numbers (p) for each individual square on the board (n^2).  That is why the brute force search time complexity is O(n^2p).  \n",
